# Dev Containers

create a file called **".env"**. Use the file **env.sample** to start.


This projects hosts developer container I use for different functions. GITHUB Actions are present to publish the main branch them to [https://hub.docker.com/u/mmontuori].

Check the **containerfiles** directory to see the different containers built.

While this is a project I used for my purposes, suggextions are always welcomed. Please feel free to either email me or post an issue.
